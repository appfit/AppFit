## Welcome to the AppFit Project

When you are ready to deploy your application on a public cloud service such as AWS, Google Cloud or Azure, how do you pick the right instance sizes for your application components? Most teams end up over-provisioning the cloud instances which can potentially cost thousands of dollars in wasted expenditure.

We are currently developing a tool which helps development teams and small businesses right-size their application containers for the cloud.

AppFit is a tool to help analyze your existing applications, run some performance measurements on them and recommend the right-sized cloud instances.
